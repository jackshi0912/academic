I used the list's isEmpty method for the stack's isEmpty method because the 
stack is empty when the list is empty. The list's isEmpty method returns true 
if the list is empty.
I used removeLast method to remove the element on top of the stack. I used this
particular method because I defined the tail of the list as the top of the 
stack. The head is the bottom of the stack.
Since Stack's IO configuration is first in last out, I used removeLast method 
of the list to remove an element from the top of the stack. I implemented it 
this way because the tail is defined as the top of the stack.
I used the list's size method as the stack's own size method because all the 
stack's data are going to be stored in the list. The list's size is therefore 
the same as the stack's size.
