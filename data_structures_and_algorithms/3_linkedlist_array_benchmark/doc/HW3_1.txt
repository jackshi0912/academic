	The original equation's highest term is n^2,  Θ(n) is not true because even though Ω(n) holds, O(n) is false. n grow slower than n^2.
12. False
	The original equation's highest term is n^2,  Θ(n^3) is not true because even though O(n^3) holds, O(n^3) is false. n^3 grow faster than n^2.

	c = 1000; n_0 = 1
14. True
	c = 100; n_0 = 1
15. False
	The original equation's highest term is log(n)*n^2,  Θ(n^2) is not true because even though Ω(n^2) holds, O(n^2) is false. log(n)*n grows faster than n^2.
