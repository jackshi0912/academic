Array:
    I expected the runtime to be n^2 since each time an element is added, the 
array of size n must be iterated through entirely to copy the data to a larger
array. This process is iterated n times created a compound runtime of "n^2".
The actual runtime appears to be quadratic as expected (I'm running linux on 
a virtual machine so the performance can vary based on my main system load.
The data may not appear as pretty)

LinkedList:
    I expected the runtime to be constant since the adding to the beginning 
operation really only involve changing the references of the head and the 
newly added node. The runtime of this particular operation does not depend on
the size of the the list. The plot confirmed my expectation since all the data
are between 0.1 and 0.5. Once the scale is adjusted based to match the Array 
data, the constant behavior becomes more apparant.
