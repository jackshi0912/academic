Question 1:
	Constructor uses the information from the parameter. It has no businese
	creating temporary object because constructors are not functions where
	stackframes can just be destroyed. If the data passing in is huge, it
	could be expensive to create a copy. Passing by reference must be
	constant so that the original data is not modified.
Question 2:
	a. The post-increment operator takes a dummy argument to distinguish
	   itself from he pre-increment.
	b. Pre-increment for iterators, by returning refernce, allow immediate
	   access to the most updated value. Post increment provide the value
	   that is no longer the most up to date. It make a lot of sense in the
	   case of iterators.
