## Installing Haskell

You should install the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).
If the installation doesn't come with _stack_, you may also have to install
manually by following [this
guide](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/).


## Overview

This is a _warm up_ assignment which will provide you with a quick introduction
to Haskell.

To this end, you will, reimplement certain problems from CSE 130 in Haskell.
Recall that the problems require relatively little code ranging from 2 to 15
lines.  If any function requires more than that, you can be sure that you need
to rethink your solution.

1. [lib/Warmup.hs](/lib/Warmup.hs) has skeleton functions with missing bodies
   that you will fill in,
2. [tests/Test.hs](/tests/Test.hs) has some sample tests, and testing code that
   you will use to check your assignments before submitting.

You should only need to modify the parts of the files which say:

```haskell
error "TBD: ..."
```

with suitable Haskell code.

**NOTE:** Start early, to avoid any unexpected shocks late in the process.

## Assignment Testing and Evaluation

Most of the points, will be awarded automatically, by **evaluating your
functions against a given test suite**.

[Tests.hs](/tests/Test.hs) contains a very small suite of tests which gives you
a flavor of of these tests.  When you run

```shell
$ stack test
```

Your last lines should have

```
All N tests passed (...)
OVERALL SCORE = ... / ...
```

**OR**

```
K out of N tests failed
OVERALL SCORE = ... / ...
```

**If your output does not have one of the above your submission will receive a 0.**

If, for some problem, you cannot get the code to compile, leave it as is with
the `error ...` with your partial solution enclosed below as a comment.

The other lines will give you a readout for each test.
You are encouraged to try to understand the testing code, but you will not be
graded on this.


## Problem 1: [Roots and Persistence](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AdditivePersistence.html)

### (a) 10 points

Fill in the implementation of

```haskell
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList xs = error "TBD:sumList"
```

such that `sumList xs` is the sum of the integer elements of `xs`. Once you
have implemented the function, you should get the following behavior in GHCi:

```haskell
ghci> sumList [1, 2, 3, 4]
10

ghci> sumList [1, -2, 3, 5]
7

ghci> sumList [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
36
```

## (b) 10 points

Fill in the implementation of the function

```haskell
digitsOfInt :: Int -> [Int]
digitsOfInt n = error "TBD:digitsOfInt"
```

such that `digitsOfInt n`:

* is the empty list `[]` if `n` is not positive, and otherwise
* is a list whose elements correspond to digits of `n` in the order in which
  they appear in `n`.

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following:

```haskell
ghci> digitsOfInt 3124
[3, 1, 2, 4]

ghci> digitsOfInt 352663
[3, 5, 2, 6, 6, 3]
```

### (c) 10+10 points

Consider the process of taking a number, adding its digits, then adding the
digits of the number derived from it, etc., until the remaining number has only
one digit.  The number of additions required to obtain a single digit from a
number `n` is called the *additive persistence* of `n`, and the digit obtained
is called the *digital root* of `n`.

For example, the sequence obtained from the starting number `9876` is `9876`,
`30`, `3`, so `9876` has an additive persistence of `2` and a digital root of
`3`.  You may wish to look at
<http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AdditivePersistence.html> to further understand
this.

Write two functions

```haskell
additivePersistence :: Int -> Int
additivePersistence n = error "TBD:additivePersistence"

digitalRoot :: Int -> Int
digitalRoot n = error "TBD:digitalRoot"
```

that take positive integer arguments `n` and return respectively the additive
persistence and the digital root of `n`. Once you have implemented the
functions, you should see the following behavior in GHCi:

```haskell
ghci> additivePersistence 9876
2

ghci> digitalRoot 9876
3
```

## Problem 2: Palindromes

### (a) 15 points

Without using any built-in functions (e.g. `reverse`),
write an function:

```haskell
listReverse :: [a] -> [a]
listReverse xs = error "TBD:listReverse"
```

such that `listReverse [x1,x2,...,xn]` returns the list `[xn,...,x2,x1]`
i.e. the input list but with the values in reversed order.
You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> listReverse [1, 2, 3, 4]
[4, 3, 2, 1]

ghci> listReverse ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
["d", "c", "b", "a"]
```

###(b) 10 points

A *palindrome* is a word that reads the same from left-to-right and
right-to-left. Write a function

```haskell
palindrome :: String -> Bool
palindrome w = error "TBD:palindrome"
```

such that `palindrome w` is `True` if the string `w` is a palindrome and
`False` otherwise. You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> palindrome "malayalam"
True
ghci> palindrome "myxomatosis"
False
```

## Problem 3: Folding Warm-Up

### (a) 15 points

Fill in the skeleton given for `sqSum`, which uses `foldl'` (the equivalent of
the fold left function you wrote in JS`) to get a function

```haskell
sqSum :: [Int] -> Int
```

such that `sqSum [x1,...,xn]` is the integer `x1^2 + ... + xn^2` (here `^2`
means squared; it's not real code).

Your task is to fill in the appropriate values for

1. the folding function `f` and
2. the base case `base`.

Once you have implemented the function, you should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> sqSum []
0

ghci> sqSum [1, 2, 3, 4]
30

ghci> sqSum [(-1), (-2), (-3), (-4)]
30
```

### (b) 30 points

Fill in the skeleton given for `pipe` using `foldl'`

```haskell
pipe :: [(a -> a)] -> (a -> a)
```

such that `pipe [f1,...,fn] x` (where `f1,...,fn` are functions!) is equal to
`f1 (f2 ( ... (fn x)))`.

Again, your task is to fill in the appropriate values for

1. the folding function `f` and
2. the base case `base`.

Once you have implemented the function, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> pipe [] 3
3

ghci> pipe [(\x -> x+x), (\x -> x + 3)] 3
12

ghci> pipe [(\x -> x * 4), (\x -> x + x)] 3
24
```

### (c) 20 points

Fill in the skeleton given for `sepConcat`, which uses `foldl'` to get a
function

```haskell
sepConcat :: String -> [String] -> String
```

Intuitively, the call `sepConcat sep [s1,...,sn]` where

* `sep` is a string to be used as a separator, and
* `[s1,...,sn]` is a list of strings

should have the following semantics:

* `sepConcat sep []` is the empty string `""`,
* `sepConcat sep [s]` is just the string `s`,
* otherwise (if there is more than one string) the function should produce the
  string `s1 ++ sep ++ s2 ++ ... ++ sep ++ sn`.

You should only modify the parts of the skeleton consisting of `error "TBD" "`.
You will need to define the function `f`, and give values for `base` and `l`.

Once done, you should see the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> sepConcat ", " ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
"foo, bar, baz"

ghci> sepConcat "---" []
""

ghci> sepConcat "" ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
"abcde"

ghci> sepConcat "X" ["hello"]
"hello"
```

### (d) 10 points

Implement the function

```haskell
stringOfList :: (a -> String) -> [a] -> String
```

such that `stringOfList f [x1,...,xn]` produces the string
`"[" ++ (f x1) ++ ", " ++ ... ++ (f xn) ++ "]"`

This function can be implemented in one line, **without using any recursion**
by calling `map` and `sepConcat` with appropriate inputs.

You should see the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> stringOfList show [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"

ghci> stringOfList (fun x -> x) ["foo"]
"[foo]"

ghci> stringOfList (stringOfList show) [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6], []]
"[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6], []]"
```

## Problem 4: Big Numbers

The Haskell type `Int` only contains values up to a certain size.  For example,

```haskell
ghci> let x = 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 :: Int

<interactive>:3:9: Warning:
    Literal 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 is out of the Int range -9223372036854775808..9223372036854775807
```

You will now implement functions to manipulate arbitrarily large numbers
represented as `[Int]`, i.e. lists of `Int`s.

### (a) 10 + 5 + 10 points

Write a function

```haskell
clone :: a -> Int -> [a]
```

such that `clone x n` returns a list of `n` copies of the value `x`.
If the integer `n` is `0` or negative, then `clone` should return
the empty list. You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> clone 3 5
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

ghci> clone "foo" 2
["foo", "foo"]
```

Use `clone` to write a function

```haskell
padZero :: [Int] -> [Int] -> ([Int], [Int])
```

which takes two lists: `[x1,...,xn]` `[y1,...,ym]` and adds zeros in front of
the _shorter_ list to make the lists of qual length.

Your implementation should **not** be recursive.

You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> padZero [9, 9] [1, 0, 0, 2]
([0, 0, 9, 9], [1, 0, 0, 2])

ghci> padZero [1, 0, 0, 2] [9, 9]
([1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 9, 9])
```

Next, write a function

```haskell
removeZero :: [Int] -> [Int]
```

that takes a list and removes a prefix of leading zeros, yielding
the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> removeZero [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2]
[1, 0, 0, 2]

ghci> removeZero [9, 9]
[9, 9]

ghci> removeZero [0, 0, 0, 0]
[]
```

### (b) 25 points

Let us use the list `[d1, d2, ..., dn]`, where each `di` is between `0` and
`9`, to represent the (positive) **big-integer** `d1d2...dn`.

```haskell
type BigInt = [Int]
```

For example, `[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8]` represents the big-integer
`9999999998`. Fill out the implementation for

```haskell
bigAdd :: BigInt -> BigInt -> BigInt
```

so that it takes two integer lists, where each integer is between `0` and `9`
and returns the list corresponding to the addition of the two big-integers.
Again, you have to fill in the implementation to supply the appropriate values
to `f`, `base`, `args`. You should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> bigAdd [9, 9] [1, 0, 0, 2]
[1, 1, 0, 1]

ghci> bigAdd [9, 9, 9, 9] [9, 9, 9]
[1, 0, 9, 9, 8]
```

Note that you're using foldr this time. The folding function `f` for `foldr` is
slightly different since it takes list element as its first argument and the
accumlator as its second.

### (c) 15 + 20 points

Next you will write functions to multiply two big integers.  First write a
function

```haskell
mulByDigit :: Int -> BigInt -> BigInt
```

which takes an integer digit and a big integer, and returns the big integer
list which is the result of multiplying the big integer with the digit. You
should get the following behavior:

```haskell
ghci> mulByDigit 9 [9,9,9,9]
[8,9,9,9,1]
```

Now, using `mulByDigit`, fill in the implementation of

```haskell
bigMul :: BigInt -> BigInt -> BigInt
```

Again, you have to fill in implementations for `f` , `base` , `args` only.
Once you are done, you should get the following behavior at the prompt:

```haskell
ghci> bigMul [9,9,9,9] [9,9,9,9]
[9,9,9,8,0,0,0,1]

ghci> bigMul [9,9,9,9,9] [9,9,9,9,9]
[9,9,9,9,8,0,0,0,0,1]
```
