/* QUESTION 1 (5pts):
 *
 * You will implement a for-loop like construct, for_, using first-class
 * functions.
 *
 * for_ takes 4 arguments:
 *
 *   - cur: the initial current value
 *
 *   - cond: the function that is used to decide whether or not we should
 *   execute the "loop" body. The cond function expects an argument whose type
 *   is the same as that of cur; the cond function is expected to return a
 *   boolean.
 *
 *   - next: the function that is used to compute the "next" current value.
 *   Like cond, next expects an argument whose type is the same as that of cur;
 *   the next function is expected to return a value of the same type.
 *
 *   - fbody: the function corresponding to the loop body. This function is
 *   called with the cur value as an argument.
 *
 *   See examples/helpers-for-{1,2,3}.js for examples that demonstrate how to
 *   use for_ in place of for-loops. These files also describe the expected
 *   behavior of for_.

/* QUESTION 2 (5pts):

 * Using the above for_ construct, you will now implement a construct for
 * iterating over elements of an array. each takes a list and a function f. For
 * each element in the list, the function calls f with the element and the
 * index of the element in the list.
