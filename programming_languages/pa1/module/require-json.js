/* In this module we are going to extend require()'s support to load '.json'

 * loader (require_.loader) to call our loadJSONFile().

/* QUESTION 5 (5pts):
 *
 * Implement a function that loads the serialized JSON object contained in the
 * file at absolute path `resolvedName`. The function should return the parsed
 * JSON object and update the require._cache.
 *
 * You will want to use JSON.parse to actually parse the file contents. If you
 * have not done this before, take a look at:
 *
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse
 *
 * You can think of JSON objects as a format for representing (a subset of)
 * literal JavaScript objects as we have seen in class. JSON.parse simply
 * turns a string into one such object.

function loadJSONFile(resolvedName) {
  if (!(resolvedName in require_._cache)) {
    require_._cache[resolvedName] = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(resolvedName));
  }
  return require_._cache[resolvedName];
}

exports.loadJSONFile = loadJSONFile;

/* QUESTION 6 (15pts):
 *
 * Now that we have a function that knows how to handle '.json' files, let's
 * put it to work by registering a new loader.
 *
 * Specifically, let's redefine require_.loader to handle '.json' files. Note
 * that the default require_.loader handles '.js' files. We want to allow for
 * handling such files, but additionally want to add support for '.json' files.
 * In other words, an incorrect solution is one that only handles '.json'
 * files, as such:
 *
 *    require_.loader = (resolvedName, nextLoader) => {
 *      if (path.extname(resolvedName) === '.json') {
 *        return loadJSONFile(resolvedName);
 *      } else {
 *        return nextLoader(resolvedName);
 *      }
 *    };
 *
 * A correct solution should essentially have loaders executing in this order:
 *
 *   if is .json file
 *    then loadJSONFile
 *    else
 *      if .js file
 *        then loadJSFile
 *        else fail
 *
 * For this question you may NOT create additional variables in this module. If
 * you need to keep track of any state (hint: the original loader) you can rely
 * on the fact that JavaScript functions are first-class closures.
