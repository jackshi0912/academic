## Assignments

The programming assignment consists of 2 parts:

- Calculator.hs: you will build a simple arithmetic language, and then compile
  this language into a simple stack based instruction language.
- TypeClasses.hs: you will investigate explicit dictionary passing style for
  the Ord typeclass and local type classes.


## Grading

We have included the points-worth of each question in the comments.

## Submission

You must submit the assignment via gradescope. The class entry code is
**MV8JVW**.  Submit your assignment by uploading the following files only:

- Calculator.hs
- TypeClasses.hs

Unlike our first assignment, the autograder will not look for your files or
otherwise fix your bug. You may only upload these files and you must ensure
they can be loaded.
