        \question
            Alice and Bob play the following game.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Initially, there are $20$ numbers: $10$ numbers $1$ and $10$ numbers
                    $2$.
                \item On each step one of the players select two numbers; and if they were
                    the same, replace them by $2$; otherwise, replace them by $1$.
                \item Alice make the first move and they do moves one after another.
            \end{itemize}
            Who is the winner?
            \begin{solutionorbox}[\stretch{1}]
							Alice wins. This is a parity split problem. Regardless of what move was
							chosen, the result is the total amount of numbers is subtracted by
							one. Since there are a total of 20 numbers, and a move is not
							possible when there is only 1 number left, the problem becomes
							subtracting 1 from 19 until 0 is reached. This means that the
							first person wins since 19 is odd.
            \end{solutionorbox}

        \question
            In the subtraction game where players may subtract $1$, $2$ or $5$ chips on
            their turn, identify the N and P positions.\\
            \begin{solutionorbox}[\stretch{1}]
							Let $c$ denote the number of chips in the pile.\\
							Given a $P$ position $p$, $p+1=N$, $p+2=N$, $p+3=P$, $p+4=N$, $p+5=N$
							\begin{proof} proof by induction:
								\paragraph{base case}
							\[
							\begin{bmatrix}
								c   & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
								pos & P & N & N & P & N & N \\
							\end{bmatrix}
							\]

							\paragraph{Induction step:}Assume given 
							\[
							\begin{bmatrix}
								c   & k & k+1 & k+2 & k+3 & k+4 & k+5 \\
								pos & P & N & N & P & N & N \\
							\end{bmatrix}
							\]
							By the definition of $P$ and $N$ states, the following holds:
							\[
							\begin{bmatrix}
								c   & k+6 & k+7 & k+8 & k+9 & k+10 & k+11 \\
								pos & P & N & N & P & N & N \\
							\end{bmatrix}
							\]
							\end{proof}
