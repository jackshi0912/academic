Buffers: Color (font, back, left right), depth (z), accumulation stencil.
When you draw, you write to some buffer (most simply, front and depth)

main:
	initialize glut

Convensions:
	Use C++ STL templates to make stacks for modelview and viewing matrices
	Camera always at the origin, pointing in the -z direction
	Transformations move objects relative to the camera
	OpenGL create matrix in colum major form

Geometry:
	Points (GL_POINTS)
	Line segments (GL_LINES)
	Triangle (GL_TRIANGLES)
	More complex primitives (GLUT): Sphere, teapot, cube, ...

Vertex Array Objects define geometries

Shader setup:
	Initialize -> Create shader -> Compile shader -> Link shader
